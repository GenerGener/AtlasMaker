# AtlasMaker

the goal of this repo will be to abstract methods from hiv-atlas-maker.py development to create species-agnostic method for reference-guided mRNA modeling.

Note that because of U3-R ideosyncracies and how users might supply their input and reference genomes, it is still HIV-specific (or at least retroviral-sepecific).
